    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Banking Mortgage Project</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As a database developer, I successfully completed a comprehensive banking mortgage and loan system project, designing and implementing an ETL solution to consolidate loan applications from various sources into a unified Loan Application Database. This involved validating data for required fields and formats, developing a notification system for loan officers to address any errors, and creating a robust data warehouse to store both approved and rejected loans, ensuring scalability for future growth. Additionally, I developed comprehensive reports to provide business intelligence on various time scales, all while executing the project using Agile methodology, dividing the work into releases, sprints, and user stories to ensure timely and high-quality deliverables. This structured approach enabled the bank to streamline their loan processing and enhance decision-making capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Online Sales Project</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This project focuses on managing online and retail sales transactions by leveraging two key data processing structures: OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) for live data and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) for historical data. The project begins with the creation of a Business Requirement Document (BRD) that outlines the business needs and objectives. Based on the BRD, the team receives daily CSV files from various sources, including customer, production, category, and sales data. To ensure data integrity and avoid duplication, the existing data is first truncated before loading the new data into a staging table. The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, facilitated by SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services), extracts the data from the staging table, transforms it as needed, and loads it into the master table. This OLTP process ensures real-time data handling and transaction processing. Once the data is cleaned and transactions are completed, the OLAP process begins. The first three tables (customer, production, and category) populate the master table in the data warehouse as dimensional tables, while the sales table, which serves as the fact table, is moved to the data warehouse for analysis and reporting. This historical data is managed using Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) to maintain both current and historical records. Finally, the data is visualized using Power BI, providing insightful reports and dashboards for business analysis and decision-making.</li>
